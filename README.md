# Amazon-Bot
 Halfway there - Bot 5 of 10!
 \
 \
This bot will sign in to your Amazon account, bypassing the SMS authentication code that Amazon sends you using Tesseract-OCR (like in the TinderBot project). Once it logs into your account, it will search up the items that you want to buy and add them to your shopping cart (update line 69 in the code with the items you want). Once every item has been added to your shopping cart, the bot will then proceed to checkout, choose the cheapest shipping option that there is (if there is a Amazon Prime Students option, it will NOT select that option), and purchase the items. Have fun shopping!
